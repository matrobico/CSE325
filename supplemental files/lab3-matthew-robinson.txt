Difficulties:
Understanding the access to the ptable and how to schedule higher priority to come first took a little while for me
to understand. After an hour looking at the scheduler() function and playing around with the code on my local machine, 
I was able to implement it and see how it fits together. Adding in cps() took a little longer than it should have, 
because I just wanted to make sure that I added in everything correctly, and that I didn't add in any extra than I
needed to. For the most part though, this lab really wasn't too bad. It was really only a few lines of code as long
as you understood what to do.

To elaborate a bit more, I was thinking that you could access the nice value of the highest priority process by creating
a copy of the process structure and comparing it's fields to others, but I was had some troubles with this. To make things
easier, I decided it was easier to just find the highest priority process using an int variable set to an obviously lower
priority, then switch to that process. Most of the heavy lifting is honestly already implemented in scheduler(). Also, 
there's really only a few straight forward ways I can see this being implemented.

P.S.
I ran my own priority scheduling implementation on my local machine, because I wanted to make sure I understood how
to implement that part myself. Some of the difficulties above are just describing that.
